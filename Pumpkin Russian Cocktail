Pumpkin Russian Cocktail 

Basically, it’s a yummy twist on the classic traditional cocktail called White Russian and iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte Coffee. It’s like the definition of autumn. 

Ingredients: 

Cocktail: 

60 ml good quality vodka (cinnamon vodka, can also be greate here!) 
60 ml pumpkin spice creamer (you can swap it for 45ml of heavy cream mixed with 20grams of pumpkin puree and a pinch of cinnamon) 
30 ml Kahlua 

Rim: 
3 tbsp crushed graham crackers 
1 tbsp brown sugar 

Garnish: 
Whipped cream and cinnamon stick for garnish  

Rim: Mix crackers with sugar on a shallow plate. Sparkle the top of the glass in water and dip into the mixture, press to  coat the edge. Set aside for a moment.
Cocktail: Fill cocktail shaker with ice, then pour vodka, creamer. Shake until everything is combined and chilled.
Final: Pour mixture into the prepared glass. Top with a whipped cream and cinnamon stick. 
Enjoy my friend!
